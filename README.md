_TRIP_, _WORK_, and _LIFE_ sections are containing **_Quick Links_** card elements.

**_base.html_** template contains <div class="blur"> just after opening tag for the background _"fade-out"_ effect

**jQuery DOM Events** used for above-mentioned cards element functionality:

* Element with id **#showLinks1** was clicked
* `var thisCardLinkShow = "." + this.id + "-grid";` checking for `<div>` element with class `.showLinks1-grid`
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).show(300)` referring to `this` element to `.show()` with speed of 300 milliseconds
* `$(".blur").fadeIn(400)` loading background "blur" effect with speed of 400 milliseconds
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).addClass("rel-card");` adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element that is referring to `this` element
* `$("#Card1").addClass("wrap-rel");`  adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element with id **Card1**

The process is replicated for the `<button id="#hideLinks1">` element with the id of `#hideLinks1` for the "hiding" effect with `.removeClass("wrap-rel");` - [SOURCE CODE]() from lines **9 - 14** 

If user click anywhere on the screen _"loaded"_ elements will _"hide"_ and that is achieved with following `.click()` DOM effect on `<div class="blur>`.
`.blur` element contains absolute position properties with a z-index of 1000: [SOURCE CODE]() from lines **34 - 38**

    };
  ```

* To submit user data to the server we are declaring `send()` function in variable `var send = function(){...};` and calling that function when submit `<button>` is triggered - [CODE EXAMPLE]() from lines **60 - 76**

# TESTING

### Strategy and planning
* Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README.
* All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages
* HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).
* CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).
* Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/).

### Access Requirements
The tester must have access to MongoDB to manually verify the insertion of records to users and tips collections.

### Regression Testing
All features previously tested during development in a local environment must be regression tested in production on the live website.

### Assumptions and Dependencies
Testing is dependent on the website being deployed live on Heroku.

### Out of Scope
Only test cases listed under High-Level Test Cases will be performed as part of this testing effort.

### Test Cases and Description
