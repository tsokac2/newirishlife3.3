### **JAVASCRIPT**

### **JQUERY**
**APPLIED jQuery DOM EVENTS** for highlighting _"Quick Links"_ cards elements

**Trip.html**, **Work.html** ,and **Life.html** are containing Quick Links user card elements. Every card element contains the _**MAIN LINK**_ source to external services provider and a **"Quick Links..."** button element for loading detailed links when the user chose the services provider destination. [EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/master/assets/wireframes/quicklinks_life.png)

Card element **HTML** structure from [trip.html](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/trip.html) from lines 260 - 279 

Trip.html, Work.html and Life.html contains `<div class="blur"> just after opening `<body> tag for the background "fade-out" effect

**jQuery DOM Events** used for above-mentioned cards element functionality:

* Element with id **#showLinks1** was clicked
* `var thisCardLinkShow = "." + this.id + "-grid";` checking for `<div>` element with class `.showLinks1-grid`
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).show(300)` referring to `this` element to `.show()` with speed of 300 milliseconds
* `$(".blur").fadeIn(400)` loading background "blur" effect with speed of 400 milliseconds
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).addClass("rel-card");` adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element that is referring to `this` element
* `$("#Card1").addClass("wrap-rel");`  adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element with id **Card1**

The process is replicated for the `<button id="#hideLinks1">` element with the id of `#hideLinks1` for the "hiding" effect with `.removeClass("wrap-rel");` - [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/cards.js) from lines **9 - 14** 


If user click anywhere on the screen "loaded" elements will "hide" and that is archived with following `.click()` DOM effect on `<div class="blur>`.
`.blur` element contains absolute position properties with a z-index of 1000: [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/cards.js) from lines **34 - 38**

        })();
  </script>
  ```
  * Check `User ID` under "Integration" option on EmailJs dashboard
  * Create `sendEmail` function [CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/emailnews.js) from lines **88 - 103** 

**FROM VALIDATION DEVELOPMENT**

* Create [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget)  method addEventListener() sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target, in this case `newsletter()` function - [CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/emailnews.js) from lines **1 - 3** 
*  Create 2 validation function for UX purposes, `validateName()` and `validateEmail()` function.
* `validateName()` function is _**returning**_ Boolean value `true` or `false` that is stored in empty variable `var valid;` depending of a user input string value - [CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/emailnews.js) from lines **5 - 22**
* Implement call-back functions regarding what kind of input value was submitted by a user.
* `pushSuccessFor()` function is adding a `.success` class to the input element when user input is valid - [CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/emailnews.js) from lines **55 - 58**
* User email validation is stored in the `validateEmail()` function with a call-back function that is checking user email - [SOURCE](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php)
* To get a valid email id we use a regular expression
* Regular Expression Pattern : `/^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/`
* `testEmail()` function:

    function testEmail(email) {
        return /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/.test(email);
    };
  ```

* To submit user data to the server we are declaring `send()` function in variable `var send = function(){...};` and calling that function when submit `<button>` is triggered - [CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newIrishLife.2.0/blob/main/assets/js/emailnews.js) from lines **60 - 76**

# TESTING

Major testing web browsers included in project testing - **Google Chrome** - **Mozilla Firefox**  - **Microsoft Edge**
When the website is successfully uploaded to **GitHub** and the website URL is generated, the testing process can start:

* STEP 1.	  Copy website URL to -  **W3C Mark-up Validation Service**
* STEP 2.	  Correct all code errors and warnings - a possible source of solutions on **stack overflow** -  https://stackoverflow.com/
* STEP 3.	  Check any console error by using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox  **Developer Tools** -  shortcut - Ctrl + Shift + I
* STEP 4.	  By using Developers Tools chose option **Toggle device toolbar** and test the website on all devices - starting from the smallest device and working to the largest
* STEP 5.	  When testing the website on multiple devices and screen sizes is recommended to check viewport rotation on mobile devices since the viewport is different for portrait and landscape orientation.
* STEP 6.	  Check website breaking points for smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices
* STEP 7.   Check paragraph margins, padding, and font sizing on small and larger devices
* STEP 8.	  Make sure all external links are opening in a separate browser tab and leading the user to the correct website destination
* STEP 9.	  Check colors contras for foreground and background colours by using **Contrast Checker** - https://contrastchecker.com/
* STEP 10.  Check code organization for future updates

SOLUTION:
1. If this key is intended to be public (or if a publicly accessible key isn’t preventable):
	- Log in to the Google Cloud Console and review the API and billing activity on your account, ensuring the usage is in line with what you expected.
	- Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.
2. If this key was NOT meant to be public:
	- Regenerate the compromised API key: Search for Credentials in the cloud console platform, Edit the leaked key, and use the Regenerate Key button to rotate the key. For more details, review the instructions     on handling compromised GCP credentials.
	- Take immediate steps to ensure that your API key(s) are not embedded in public source code systems, stored in download directories, or unintentionally shared in other ways.
	- Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.
The security of your Google Cloud Platform account(s) is important to us.
